# section name is an arbitrary label

# paths and patterns are used to make a decision about whether a level 2
# object (a child of the root object, e.g. Device.DeviceInfo.), is included
# in the group:
# - paths are relative to the root object, e.g. relative to Device.
# - patterns are relative to the candidate level 2 object, e.g. relative to
#   Device.IP.
