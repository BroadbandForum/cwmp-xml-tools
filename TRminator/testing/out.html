If the ACS sets the value of this parameter to {{enum|Requested}}, the CPE MUST initiate the corresponding diagnostic test.  When writing, the only allowed value is {{enum|Requested}}.  To ensure the use of the proper test parameters (the writable parameters in this object), the test parameters MUST be set either prior to or at the same time as (in the same SetParameterValues) setting the {{param}} to {{enum|Requested}}.
When requested, the CPE SHOULD wait until after completion of the communication session with the ACS before starting the diagnostic.
When the test is completed, the value of this parameter MUST be either {{enum|Complete}} (if the test completed successfully), or one of the ''Error'' values listed above.
If the value of this parameter is anything other than {{enum|Complete}}, the values of the results parameters for this test are indeterminate.
When the diagnostic initiated by the ACS is completed (successfully or not), the CPE MUST establish a new connection to the ACS to allow the ACS to view the results, indicating the Event code ''8 DIAGNOSTICS COMPLETE'' in the Inform message.
After the diagnostic is complete, the value of all result parameters (all read-only parameters in this object instance) MUST be retained by the CPE until either this diagnostic is run again, or the CPE reboots.  After a reboot, if the CPE has not retained the result parameters from the most recent test, it MUST set the value of this parameter to {{enum|None}}.
Modifying any of the writable parameters in this object except for this one MUST result in the value of this parameter being set to {{enum|None}}.
While the test is in progress, modifying any of the writable parameters in this object except for this one MUST result in the test being terminated and the value of this parameter being set to {{enum|None}}.
While the test is in progress, setting this parameter to {{enum|Requested}} (and possibly modifying other writable parameters in this object) MUST result in the test being terminated and then restarted using the current values of the test parameters.</TD>

If the ACS sets the value of this parameter to {{enum|Requested}}, the CPE MUST initiate the corresponding diagnostic test, which brings down the DSL connection while the test is operating.  When writing, the only allowed value is {{enum|Requested}}.
When requested, the CPE SHOULD wait until after completion of the communication session with the ACS before starting the diagnostic.
When the test is completed, the value of this parameter MUST be either {{enum|Complete}} (if the test completed successfully), or one of the ''Error'' values listed above.
If the value of this parameter is anything other than {{enum|Complete}}, the values of the results parameters for this test are indeterminate.
When the diagnostic initiated by the ACS is completed, the CPE MUST establish a new connection to the ACS to allow the ACS to view the results, indicating the corresponding reason in the Inform message.
After the diagnostic is complete, the value of all result parameters (all read-only parameters in this object instance) MUST be retained by the CPE until either this diagnostic is run again, or the CPE reboots.  After a reboot, if the CPE has not retained the result parameters from the most recent test, it MUST set the value of this parameter to {{enum|None}}.</TD>

If the ACS sets the value of this parameter to {{enum|Requested}}, the CPE MUST initiate the corresponding diagnostic test.  When writing, the only allowed value is {{enum|Requested}}.  To ensure the use of the proper test parameters (the writable parameters in this object), the test parameters MUST be set either prior to or at the same time as (in the same SetParameterValues) setting the {{param}} to {{enum|Requested}}.
When requested, the CPE SHOULD wait until after completion of the communication session with the ACS before starting the diagnostic.
When the test is completed, the value of this parameter MUST be either {{enum|Complete}} (if the test completed successfully), or one of the ''Error'' values listed above.
If the value of this parameter is anything other than {{enum|Complete}}, the values of the results parameters for this test are indeterminate.
When the diagnostic initiated by the ACS is completed (successfully or not), the CPE MUST establish a new connection to the ACS to allow the ACS to view the results, indicating the Event code ''8 DIAGNOSTICS COMPLETE'' in the Inform message.
After the diagnostic is complete, the value of all result parameters (all read-only parameters in this object instance) MUST be retained by the CPE until either this diagnostic is run again, or the CPE reboots.  After a reboot, if the CPE has not retained the result parameters from the most recent test, it MUST set the value of this parameter to {{enum|None}}.
Modifying any of the writable parameters in this object except for this one MUST result in the value of this parameter being set to {{enum|None}}.
While the test is in progress, modifying any of the writable parameters in this object except for this one MUST result in the test being terminated and the value of this parameter being set to {{enum|None}}.
While the test is in progress, setting this parameter to {{enum|Requested}} (and possibly modifying other writable parameters in this object) MUST result in the test being terminated and then restarted using the current values of the test parameters.</TD>

When {{param}} is a wildcard, all traffic sent to the {{param|ExternalPort}} on the WAN interface of the gateway is forwarded to the {{param|InternalClient}} on the {{param|InternalPort}}.
When {{param}} is specified as one external IP address, the NAT will only forward inbound packets from this {{param}} to the {{param|InternalClient}}, all other packets will be dropped. 
If a CPE supports non-wildcard values for {{param}}, it MAY additionally support the ability to have more than one port mapping with the same {{param|ExternalPort}} and {{param|PortMappingProtocol}}, but with differing values of {{param}}.
When wildcard values are used for {{param}} and/or {{param|ExternalPort}}, the following precedence order applies (with the highest precedence listed first):

Support for DNS host names is OPTIONAL.  If {{param}} is specified as a DNS host name and the LAN device's IP address subsequently changes, the port mapping MUST remain associated with this LAN device.

A value of 1 or greater indicates an Exclusive Filter, where the value 1 indicates the first entry to be considered (highest precedence).
A value of 0 indicates a Non-Exclusive Filter.
For each packet, if the packet matches any Exclusive Filters, the packet is assigned to the Bridge associated with the highest precedence Exclusive Filter to which it matches (lowest {{param}} value).
If and only if the packet does not match any Exclusive Filters, the packet is assigned to all Bridges associated with each Non-Exclusive Filter for which it matches the defining criteria.
If a packet matches no Filter, it is discarded.
When the {{param}} is set to match that of an existing Exclusive Filter (1 or greater), the value for the existing entry and all higher numbered entries is incremented (lowered in precedence) to ensure uniqueness of this value. A deletion or change in {{param}} of an Exclusive Filter causes {{param}} values of other Exclusive Filters (values 1 or greater) to be compacted.
Note that the use of Exclusive Filters to associate a layer-3 router interface with LAN and/or WAN interfaces via a Bridge entry overrides the default association between layer-3 and layer-2 objects implied by the ''InternetGatewayDevice'' object hierarchy.</TD>

In addition to statically configured routes, this table MUST include dynamic routes learned through layer-3 routing protocols, including RIP, OSPF, DHCP, and IPCP.  The CPE MAY reject attempts to delete or modify a dynamic route entry.
For each incoming packet, the layer-3 forwarding decision is conceptually made as follows:
* Only table entries with a matching {{param|ForwardingPolicy}} are considered, i.e. those that either do not specify a {{param|ForwardingPolicy}}, or else specify a {{param|ForwardingPolicy}} that matches that of the incoming packet. 
* For the remaining table entries, those for which the source address/mask matches are sorted by longest prefix, i.e. with the most specific networks first (an unspecified source address is a wild-card and always matches, with a prefix length of zero). 
* For the remaining table entries, those for which the destination address/mask matches are sorted by longest prefix, i.e. with the most specific networks first (an unspecified destination address is a wild-card and always matches, with a prefix length of zero).

A value of 1 or greater indicates an Exclusive Filter, where the value 1 indicates the first entry to be considered (highest precedence).
A value of 0 indicates a Non-Exclusive Filter.
For each packet, if the packet matches any Exclusive Filters, the packet is assigned to the Bridge associated with the highest precedence Exclusive Filter to which it matches (lowest {{param}} value).
If and only if the packet does not match any Exclusive Filters, the packet is assigned to all Bridges associated with each Non-Exclusive Filter for which it matches the defining criteria.
If a packet matches no Filter, it is discarded.
When the {{param}} is set to match that of an existing Exclusive Filter (1 or greater), the value for the existing entry and all higher numbered entries is incremented (lowered in precedence) to ensure uniqueness of this value. A deletion or change in {{param}} of an Exclusive Filter causes {{param}} values of other Exclusive Filters (values 1 or greater) to be compacted.
Note that the use of Exclusive Filters to associate a layer-3 router interface with LAN and/or WAN interfaces via a Bridge entry overrides the default association between layer-3 and layer-2 objects implied by the ''InternetGatewayDevice'' object hierarchy.</TD>

If the ACS sets the value of this parameter to {{enum|Requested}}, the CPE MUST initiate the corresponding diagnostic test.  When writing, the only allowed value is {{enum|Requested}}.  To ensure the use of the proper test parameters (the writable parameters in this object), the test parameters MUST be set either prior to or at the same time as (in the same SetParameterValues) setting the {{param}} to {{enum|Requested}}.
When requested, the CPE SHOULD wait until after completion of the communication session with the ACS before starting the diagnostic.
When the test is completed, the value of this parameter MUST be either {{enum|Complete}} (if the test completed successfully), or one of the ''Error'' values listed above.
If the value of this parameter is anything other than {{enum|Complete}}, the values of the results parameters for this test are indeterminate.
When the diagnostic initiated by the ACS is completed (successfully or not), the CPE MUST establish a new connection to the ACS to allow the ACS to view the results, indicating the Event code ''8 DIAGNOSTICS COMPLETE'' in the Inform message.
After the diagnostic is complete, the value of all result parameters (all read-only parameters in this object instance) MUST be retained by the CPE until either this diagnostic is run again, or the CPE reboots.  After a reboot, if the CPE has not retained the result parameters from the most recent test, it MUST set the value of this parameter to {{enum|None}}.
Modifying any of the writable parameters in this object except for this one MUST result in the value of this parameter being set to {{enum|None}}.
While the test is in progress, modifying any of the writable parameters in this object except for this one MUST result in the test being terminated and the value of this parameter being set to {{enum|None}}.
While the test is in progress, setting this parameter to {{enum|Requested}} (and possibly modifying other writable parameters in this object) MUST result in the test being terminated and then restarted using the current values of the test parameters.</TD>

Note that the reason for a PPP connection becoming disconnected to begin with might be either external to the CPE, such as termination by the BRAS or momentary disconnection of the physical interface, or internal to the CPE, such as use of the {{param|IdleDisconnectTime}} and/or {{param|AutoDisconnectTime}} parameters in this object.</TD>

For a dynamic (non-static) port mapping, when this parameter is read, the value represents the time remaining on the port-mapping lease.  That is, for a dynamic port mapping, the value counts down toward 0.  When a dynamic port-mapping lease expires, the CPE MUST automatically terminate that port mapping, and MUST automatically delete the corresponding ''PortMapping'' table entry.</TD>

When {{param}} is a wildcard, all traffic sent to the {{param|ExternalPort}} on the WAN interface of the gateway is forwarded to the {{param|InternalClient}} on the {{param|InternalPort}}.
When {{param}} is specified as one external IP address, the NAT will only forward inbound packets from this {{param}} to the {{param|InternalClient}}, all other packets will be dropped. 
If a CPE supports non-wildcard values for {{param}}, it MAY additionally support the ability to have more than one port mapping with the same {{param|ExternalPort}} and {{param|PortMappingProtocol}}, but with differing values of {{param}}.
When wildcard values are used for {{param}} and/or {{param|ExternalPort}}, the following precedence order applies (with the highest precedence listed first):
# Explicit {{param}}, explicit {{param|ExternalPort}}
# Explicit {{param}}, wildcard {{param|ExternalPort}}
# Wildcard {{param}}, explicit {{param|ExternalPort}}
# Wildcard {{param}}, wildcard {{param|ExternalPort}}

		<TD>(bibref: replace) The external port that the NAT gateway would listen on for connection requests to a corresponding {{param|InternalPort}}. Inbound packets to this external port on the WAN interface SHOULD be forwarded to {{param|InternalClient}} on the {{param|InternalPort}}.
A value of zero (0) represents a "wildcard".  If this value is a wildcard, connection request on all external ports (that are not otherwise mapped) will be forwarded to {{param|InternalClient}}.  In the wildcard case, the value(s) of {{param|InternalPort}} on {{param|InternalClient}} are ignored.

		<TD>InternalClient</TD>
		<TD>string</TD>

		<TD>(bibref: replace) The IP address or DNS host name of an internal client (on the LAN).
Support for an IP address is mandatory.  If {{param}} is specified as an IP address and the LAN device's IP address subsequently changes, the port mapping MUST remain associated with the original IP address.
Support for DNS host names is OPTIONAL.  If {{param}} is specified as a DNS host name and the LAN device's IP address subsequently changes, the port mapping MUST remain associated with this LAN device.  In this case, it is the responsibility of the CPE to maintain the name-to-address mapping in the event of IP address changes.  This can be accomplished, for example, by assigning the DNS host name via use of DHCP option 12 (Host Name) or option 81 (FQDN).  Note that the ACS can learn the host name associated with a given LAN device via the ''Hosts'' table ({{object|InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.{i}.Hosts}}).
Read access to this parameter MUST always return the exact value that was last set by the ACS.  For example, if the internal client is set to a DNS host name, it MUST read back as a DNS host name and not as an IP address.
{{empty}} indicates an unconfigured {{param}}. If this parameter is unconfigured, this port mapping MUST NOT be operational.
It MUST be possible to set the {{param}} to the broadcast IP address 255.255.255.255 for UDP mappings. This is to enable multiple NAT clients to use the same well-known port simultaneously.</TD>

When {{param}} is a wildcard, all traffic sent to the {{param|ExternalPort}} on the WAN interface of the gateway is forwarded to the {{param|InternalClient}} on the {{param|InternalPort}}.
When {{param}} is specified as one external IP address, the NAT will only forward inbound packets from this {{param}} to the {{param|InternalClient}}, all other packets will be dropped. 
If a CPE supports non-wildcard values for {{param}}, it MAY additionally support the ability to have more than one port mapping with the same {{param|ExternalPort}} and {{param|PortMappingProtocol}}, but with differing values of {{param}}.
When wildcard values are used for {{param}} and/or {{param|ExternalPort}}, the following precedence order applies (with the highest precedence listed first):

Support for an IP address is mandatory.  If {{param}} is specified as an IP address and the LAN device's IP address subsequently changes, the port mapping MUST remain associated with the original IP address.
Support for DNS host names is OPTIONAL.  If {{param}} is specified as a DNS host name and the LAN device's IP address subsequently changes, the port mapping MUST remain associated with this LAN device.  In this case, it is the responsibility of the CPE to maintain the name-to-address mapping in the event of IP address changes.  This can be accomplished, for example, by assigning the DNS host name via use of DHCP option 12 (Host Name) or option 81 (FQDN).  Note that the ACS can learn the host name associated with a given LAN device via the ''Hosts'' table ({{object|InternetGatewayDevice.LANDevice.{i}.Hosts}}).
Read access to this parameter MUST always return the exact value that was last set by the ACS.  For example, if the internal client is set to a DNS host name, it MUST read back as a DNS host name and not as an IP address.
{{empty}} indicates an unconfigured {{param}}. If this parameter is unconfigured, this port mapping MUST NOT be operational.
It MUST be possible to set the {{param}} to the broadcast IP address 255.255.255.255 for UDP mappings. This is to enable multiple NAT clients to use the same well-known port simultaneously.</TD>

If the ACS sets the value of this parameter to {{enum|Requested}}, the CPE MUST initiate the corresponding diagnostic test.  When writing, the only allowed value is {{enum|Requested}}.  To ensure the use of the proper test parameters (the writable parameters in this object), the test parameters MUST be set either prior to or at the same time as (in the same SetParameterValues) setting the {{param}} to {{enum|Requested}}.
When requested, the CPE SHOULD wait until after completion of the communication session with the ACS before starting the diagnostic.
When the test is completed, the value of this parameter MUST be either {{enum|Complete}} (if the test completed successfully), or one of the ''Error'' values listed above.
If the value of this parameter is anything other than {{enum|Complete}}, the values of the results parameters for this test are indeterminate.
When the diagnostic initiated by the ACS is completed (successfully or not), the CPE MUST establish a new connection to the ACS to allow the ACS to view the results, indicating the Event code ''8 DIAGNOSTICS COMPLETE'' in the Inform message.
After the diagnostic is complete, the value of all result parameters (all read-only parameters in this object instance) MUST be retained by the CPE until either this diagnostic is run again, or the CPE reboots.  After a reboot, if the CPE has not retained the result parameters from the most recent test, it MUST set the value of this parameter to {{enum|None}}.
Modifying any of the writable parameters in this object except for this one MUST result in the value of this parameter being set to {{enum|None}}.
While the test is in progress, modifying any of the writable parameters in this object except for this one MUST result in the test being terminated and the value of this parameter being set to {{enum|None}}.
While the test is in progress, setting this parameter to {{enum|Requested}} (and possibly modifying other writable parameters in this object) MUST result in the test being terminated and then restarted using the current values of the test parameters.</TD>

If the ACS sets the value of this parameter to {{enum|Requested}}, the CPE MUST initiate the corresponding diagnostic test, which brings down the DSL connection while the test is operating.  When writing, the only allowed value is {{enum|Requested}}.
When requested, the CPE SHOULD wait until after completion of the communication session with the ACS before starting the diagnostic.
When the test is completed, the value of this parameter MUST be either {{enum|Complete}} (if the test completed successfully), or one of the ''Error'' values listed above.
If the value of this parameter is anything other than {{enum|Complete}}, the values of the results parameters for this test are indeterminate.
When the diagnostic initiated by the ACS is completed, the CPE MUST establish a new connection to the ACS to allow the ACS to view the results, indicating the corresponding reason in the Inform message.
After the diagnostic is complete, the value of all result parameters (all read-only parameters in this object instance) MUST be retained by the CPE until either this diagnostic is run again, or the CPE reboots.  After a reboot, if the CPE has not retained the result parameters from the most recent test, it MUST set the value of this parameter to {{enum|None}}.</TD>

If the ACS sets the value of this parameter to {{enum|Requested}}, the CPE MUST initiate the corresponding diagnostic test.  When writing, the only allowed value is {{enum|Requested}}.  To ensure the use of the proper test parameters (the writable parameters in this object), the test parameters MUST be set either prior to or at the same time as (in the same SetParameterValues) setting the {{param}} to {{enum|Requested}}.
When requested, the CPE SHOULD wait until after completion of the communication session with the ACS before starting the diagnostic.
When the test is completed, the value of this parameter MUST be either {{enum|Complete}} (if the test completed successfully), or one of the ''Error'' values listed above.
If the value of this parameter is anything other than {{enum|Complete}}, the values of the results parameters for this test are indeterminate.
When the diagnostic initiated by the ACS is completed (successfully or not), the CPE MUST establish a new connection to the ACS to allow the ACS to view the results, indicating the Event code ''8 DIAGNOSTICS COMPLETE'' in the Inform message.
After the diagnostic is complete, the value of all result parameters (all read-only parameters in this object instance) MUST be retained by the CPE until either this diagnostic is run again, or the CPE reboots.  After a reboot, if the CPE has not retained the result parameters from the most recent test, it MUST set the value of this parameter to {{enum|None}}.
Modifying any of the writable parameters in this object except for this one MUST result in the value of this parameter being set to {{enum|None}}.
While the test is in progress, modifying any of the writable parameters in this object except for this one MUST result in the test being terminated and the value of this parameter being set to {{enum|None}}.
While the test is in progress, setting this parameter to {{enum|Requested}} (and possibly modifying other writable parameters in this object) MUST result in the test being terminated and then restarted using the current values of the test parameters.</TD>
