<h2>
Introduction
</h2>
</a>
The following instructions are for the TRminator Graphical Interface.
<br>
If you are interested in the command-line interface of TRminator, go <a href="cli.html">here</a>.

<h2>
Running TRminator with Graphical Interface
</h2>
</a>
There are two ways to run TRminator with the graphical interface.
<br>
In most environments, this can be done by double-clicking on the executable jar.
<br>
In all environments, the program can be run in Graphical mode via the command line:
<pre>
<b>user@host></b> java -jar TRminator.jar -gui
</pre>
There are currently no supported command-line arguments.

<h2>
Common Features to All Modes
</h2>
</a>
<p>
Each time a file location (input OR output) or option is changed, the "GO" button is disabled.
<br>
Users must click the "Load File"/"Load Files" button in order to enable the GO button.
<br>
Each time the Load button is clicked, the program makes sure it can write to the output path, and deletes any file there.
<br>
Then the input file(s) go(es) through an in-depth validation process, to ensure that no errors occurr due to a missing file.
<br>
<br>
<b>NOTICE:</b> because of this validation and possible requirement for completion of the table, 
<br>all files associated with the input file(s) via "import" statements MUST be located in top level of the directory where the input file is located.
<br>Attempts to subvert this by using [File > Change Working Directory] will likely result in error.
<br>
<h3>
Menu options
</h3>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <b>File > Change Working Directory</b> allows the user to pick a directory where they will choose input files from.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The actual benefit of this option is quite minimal, as the setting is not guaranteed to be persistent.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <b>Edit > Change Cols </b> allows the user to edit the columns that exist in the output table.
<br>
<br>
<a href="img/cole.jpg"><img src="img/thumbs/cole_thumb.jpg" alt="col_edit" /></a>
<br>
<b>NOTICE:</b> Changing the columns from the default configuration may have adverse effects, as selected features may depend on the existence of some columns.
</p>
<h2>
Using the Different Modes:
</h2>
<a name="m1">
<h3>
Versioned Document => Table (default)
</h3>
<p>
This mode is for creating an HTML table representing a versioned BBF document's content.
<br>
Each version imported (recursively) by the document is included in the table, and bibliographic information is attached in a separate table.
<br>
Consequentially, 
<br>
By default, HTML formatting is used to show the changes since the last version of the document (if applicable).
<br>
Users may toggle this feature using the "Diff final two tables" check box under "Misc. Options." 
<br>
Also available is an option to include a table of profiles.
<br>
<br>
<b>NOTICE:</b> in the event of a file with more than one model, the user will be prompted to pick the desired model from a list.
</p>
<a name="m2">
<h3>
General XML  => Table
</h3>
</a>
<p>
This mode is for creating an HTML table representing an XML document like BBF's TR-069, TR-198 documents.
<br>
Unlike the default mode, no inheritance or dependence is validated or included.
<br>
Also, the user must specify the name of the object that contains the desired data.
</p>
<a name="m3">
<h3>
Non-Sequential Documents => Diff Table
</h3>
</a>
<p>
This mode is for creating an HTML table representing the differences between a BBF document and an older version of that document.
<br>
Essentially, this mode carries out the functions of the default (first) mode twice; once for each of the files, and then compares them.
<br>
The resulting table has HTML formatting that shows the difference between the two input files.
