About TRminator
</h2>
<h3>
Purpose:
</h3>
TRminator was created for the Broadband Forum and all users of their Data Models, specifically the XML documents used for <a href="http://www.broadband-forum.org/cwmp.php">CWMP/TR-069</a>.
<br>
TRminator enables the user to create human-readable representations of the information in the XML Data Model files.
<br>
<br>
<Strong>
TRminator was created using <a href="http://www.java.com">Java 6</a>, and requires the <a href="http://www.java.com/getjava">Java Runtime Environment</a> to run.

Quick-Start Guide:

</a>
<STRONG>Introduction:</Strong>
<br>
TRminator is designed to parse information in a BBF XML document into an HTML table, and make a file of it.
<br>
<br>
<STRONG>Please Note:</STRONG>
<br> 
in order for TRminator to function correctly, all documents referred to in the XML document, including those by recursion (document referenced in a referenced document) MUST be available in the same directory as the input file.
<br>
<br>
<body>
TRminator is run via the executable Java Jar named "TRminator.jar."
<br>
<a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">Java 6</a> is required to run it.
<br>
In most environments, double-clicking the jar will run it without any arguments (doing so will invoke the graphical interface of TRminator).
<br>
<br>
Running the jar on the command line allows for arguments:
<br>
<pre>
<b>user@host></b> java -jar TRminator.jar [args]
</pre>
If no arguments are used, the graphical interface will appear.
<br>
<br>
If arguments are to be used, the first argument is a mandatory argument setting the mode:
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <b>"-cli"</b> will run TRminator's <a href="cli.html">command-line interface</a>, in the present console.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <b>"-gui"</b> will run TRminator's <a href="gui.html">graphical interface.</a>

</b>
<br>
<br>
Following the mode can be any number of arguments, in no particular order. The graphical interface does not currently support any arguments.
<br>
<strong>
The command-line interface has two mandatory arguments:
<br>
</strong>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <b>"-i [path]"</b> is the input option. It is to be followed by a string representing the path to the input file.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <b>"-o [path]"</b> is the output option. It is to be followed by a string representing the path to the output file.
<br>
<br>
For more information and arguments for the command-line interface, see its <a href="cli.html">documentation</a>

Known Issues:
</h2>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
* Saving file as .xls will make table viewable in MS Excel (97+), but formatting is not present.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
* No protection is in place to keep user from modifying columns settings in ways that interfere with the program's tabling process.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
* TRminator silently deletes any file at the output path(s); does not warn user that file exists there.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
* TRminator only supports BBF-type documents with "container" objects of type "Model." (Mode 2 of the GUI is an exception).
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
* TRminator does not currently support these BBF markup types:
