About TRminator
</h2>
</a>
<body>
TRminator is an add-on package for the Threepio XML Data Model table-maker engine.
<br>
It consists of a graphical user interface and a command-line user interface,
as well as a Post Processor for 
<a href="table.html#table">
Tables
</a> 
created by 
<a href="threepio.html">
Threepio
</a>
that processes BBF-style markup.

<h2>
The User Interfaces
</h2>
</a>
<body>
TRminator provides a graphical user interface (defined in GUI.java) and a command-line user interface (defined in CLI.java).
<br>
The GUI contains a mode for non-BBF documents, but the CLI is currently optimized for BBF documents.

<h2>
Table Post Processor
</h2>
</a>
<body>
TRminator contains a Table Post Processor that handles BBF-style markup in curly braces. It is defined in "TablePostProcessor.java."
<br>
There are Objects of class MarkupProcessor that are also defined in this file. They are used one after another, in the method doReplaces.
<br>
Some of these may have to be run before each other, if the markup handling of one creates more markup, or markup depends on data created by other markup. 
<br>
A ModelTable object created using Threepio can be run through TablePostProcessor's <b>deMarkupTable</b> method to remove and process BBF markup.
<br>
This needs to be done prior to printing the table out.
