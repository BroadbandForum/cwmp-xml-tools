<body>
Threepio is a framework written in the Java programming language that is designed to
convert the contents of an XML document similar to a Broadband Forum Data Model
into an HTML-style Table object. It also provides the ability to print these Tables out in true HTML format,
with user-specied and hard-coded conditional text formatting.
<br>
<br>
TRminator is a Java package with user interfaces, table analyzers, and table formatters. 
The package is designed and intended for Broadband Forum Data Model XML,
providing functions based on BBF markup, including general parsing and automatic table modifications.
Trminator runs on top of the Threepio framework, requiring it to function.
