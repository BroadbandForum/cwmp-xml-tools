About The The Threepio Engine
</h2>
</a>
The Threepio Engine is designed to be a small, quick, extensible XML processor 
focused on the creation of <a href="table.html#table">Tables</a> with a row for each item of a (currently) hard-coded "major item type."
<br>
There are also hard-coded column names, which are filled by the engine. Unlike the "major item type," 
it is intended that the user can define and/or re-order these.
<br>
To see completed impelmentation of User Interfaces for the Threepio engine, see information on 
<a href="trminator.html">the TRminator</a>, a set of user interfaces created for 
<a href="http://www.broadband-forum.org/">
the Broadband Forum
</a> 
for creating <a href="table.html#table">Tables</a> of their Data Models.
<br>

<h2>
The Threepio class
</h2>
</a>
<body>
<b>Package:</b> threepio.engine
<br>
<b>Description:</b> 
The Threepio class is intended to be a liason between User interfaces and the lower level classes use for creating <a href="table.html#table">Tables</a>.
<br>
It contains three methods that carry out useful sets of method calls, in three functions:
<br>
<br>
* <a name="mode1">docToTable</a> is a method that creates a <a href="table.html#table">Table</a> for a Data Model from an XML document, involving any previous versions of the model, 
as imported in the newest file. The table is then printed out to a file, in HTML format.
<br>
Options include diffing the most recent version and one previous.
<br>
<br>
* diffTWoTables carries out the function of <a href="#model1">docToTable</a> for two different versions of the same Data Model, 
and prints out a table of a diff between the two.
<br>
<br>
* xmlToPrintedTable prints out an HTML table of the contents of a user-defined "container" from an XML document.
<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> 
none
<br>
<b>Uses:</b>
<br>
Threepio has methods that work well as "cookie-cutter" ones to call from a UI.
<br>
<a href="trminator.html">the TRminator</a>
relies heavily on Threepio.
</body>

<a name="documenter">
<h2>
Documenter (Interface)
</h2>
</a>
<body>
<b>Package:</b> threepio.documenter
<br>
<b>Description:</b> 
The Documenter Interface defines methods used to create Doc objects from raw XML.
<br>
These Doc objects are simply queues of XTag objects (a class that models a Tag from HTML or XML) and Strings.
<br>
Docs are much easier to work with than the raw XML.
<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> 
Documenters must be able to convert files based solely on their XML, or based on an Entry/
<a href="classes.html#doublet">
Doublet
</a>
that has a key of the file's path as a String, and a value of the model version.
<br>
<b>Uses:</b>
<br>
<a href="#threepio">
Threepio 
</a>
uses the XDocumenter class to create XDoc objects (an implementation of Doc), when making <a href="table.html#table">Tables</a> out of XML Data Models.
</body>

<a name="tabler">
<h2>
Tabler (Abstract Class)
</h2>
</a>
<body>
<b>Package:</b> threepio.tabler
<br>
<b>Description:</b> 
The Tabler converts Doc objects to <a href="table.html#table">Table</a> objects.
<br>
These Table objects are IndexedHashMaps, with keys of row names, and values of Rows (lists of cells).
<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> 
Tablers must produce some form of Table, with input of some form of Doc.
<b>Uses:</b>
<br>
<a href="#threepio">
Threepio 
</a>
uses a TablerController object, which uses Tabler objects to create the tables that are printed out.
</body>

<a name="tabler">
<h2>
Tabler (Abstract Class)
</h2>
</a>
<body>
<b>Package:</b> threepio.tabler
<br>
<b>Description:</b> 
The Tabler class converts Doc objects to Table objects.
<br>
Table objects are IndexedHashMaps, with keys of row names, and values of Rows (lists of cells).
<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> 
Tablers must produce some form of Table, with input of some form of Doc.
<b>Uses:</b>
<br>
<a href="#threepio">
Threepio 
</a>
uses a TablerController object, which uses Tabler objects to create the tables that are printed out.
</body>

<a name="th">
<h2>
TagHandler (Abstract Class)
</h2>
</a>
<body>
<b>Package:</b> threepio.taghandler
<br>
<b>Description:</b> 
TagHandler objects are used to process XML based on a single tag type.
<br>
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> 
TagHandlers must have a type that they handle, 
and MUST ONLY handle the information that starts with that tag type and ends with a closing tag of that type.
<br>
They MUST remove the information they handled. They MUST be named in a way that denotes the type they handle.
<br>
The HandlerFactory MUST be updated with this classname.
<b>Uses:</b>
<br>
<a href="#tabler">
Tablers
</a>
rely on TagHandlers to parse Docs, through use of the HandlerFactory. 
Extension of GeneralTagHandler is often sufficient for creating a new TagHandler.
</body>

<a name="components">
<h2>
Working with Components
</h2>
</a>
<body>
Components (used in <a href="http://www.broadband-forum.org/">
Broadband Forum
</a> 
Data Models) require extra parsing work. The ModelTabler class, a 
<a href="#tabler">
Tabler,
</a>
has two getComponents methods that return a <a href="table.html#table">Table</a> based on the component objects in the document. 
</body>

<a name="profiles">
<h2>
Working with Profiles
</h2>
</a>
<body>
Profiles (used in <a href="http://www.broadband-forum.org/">
Broadband Forum
</a> 
Data Models) are defined in-line with the rest of the data in the Data Models, 
but are usually not expected to be in the same table as the rest of the data. 
For this reason, the ModelTabler class, a 
<a href="#tabler">
Tabler,
</a>
creates a single row for each profile in a separate <a href="table.html#table">Table</a>,
which can optionally be included in a table with the <a href="table.html#table">Table</a> for the main data.
