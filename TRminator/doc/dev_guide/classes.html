<h2>
Versioned (Interface)
</h2>
</a>
<body>
<b>Package:</b> threepio.container
<br>
<b>Description:</b> 
The threepio.container.Versioned interface is a simple interface for versioning.
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> 
Versioned objects will always contain a gettable and setable String, used to name or version it.
<br>
<b>Uses:</b> 
Associating two different objects as being based on the same information, such as a document and table.
</body>
<br>
<a name="doublet">
<h2>
Doublet (Class)
</h2>
</a>
<body>
<b>Package:</b> threepio.container
<br>
<b>Description:</b> 
The threepio.container.Doublet class is a minimal implementation of java.util.Map.Entry<K,V>
with a modification allowing for the key to be set. 
<br> 
Doublets are often passed to and from methods in Threepio + TRminator in an ML way.
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> 
none
<br>
<b>Uses:</b> 
Passing and returning two objects as a set, knowing or implying which is the key and which is the value.
<br> 
	Doublets can be helpful when using static methods. The programmer can modify or assign two values instead of one (using the two values returned from the method).

<a name="ihm">
<h2>
IndexedHashMap (Class)
</h2>
</a>
<body>
<b>Package:</b> threepio.tabler.container
<br>
<b>Description:</b> 
The threepio.tabler.container.IndexedHashMap class is a hybrid of HashMap and ArrayList.
<br>
Though it techincally extends the ArrayList class, the programmer should treat it more like the HashMap class.
It essentially adds the ability to put the value in an indexed location, and get it from it, but also to get
values based on a key.
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b> 
use map methods (put, putall), no use of list methods for adding and removing "add" methods (add, addall)
<br>
<b>Uses:</b> 
<a href="table.html">The Table class</a> extends IndexedHashMap. This allows for indexed rows that also have keys.
