=This utility provides a frontend for the "report.exe" tool to generate reports from CWMP xml datafiles.
=
=----------------------------
=General usage:
=----------------------------
=To use the frontend select the XML file to be processed with the Select button or the "File" menu setting.
=
=In the Standard Report mode, then select one of the offered predefined reports to be generated. With the "Generate Report" button the report generation is started. The 'report.exe' output from the generation is displayed in the log window, the generated report itself is stored in the same directory like the XML file with the name <xml filename>.<report type>.
=
=If the option "Open generated file" is activated (default) the report is opened immediatley within the linked application.
=
=If the "Publish" option is selected, all reports needed to publish the selected XML are generated. For details see the description of the publish option below.
=
=The Expert Report Mode allows to use all the different settings defined in "report.exe" tool. All selected settings are stored in the ReportGui.ini file and are available again for the next session. Profiles can be created in to save a specific set of settings for later use. 
=
=Tool tips provide help for all selectable options, input fields and buttons, hover the mouse over any field to display them.

===============================
=
=------------------------------
=  Profiles
=------------------------------
=Profiles can be created in the expert mode by entering a name in the edit field and pressing the 'Save' button. A Profile will store all settings made in the current GUI window without the selected file name and the include settings.
=
=
=------------------------------
=  Publish 
=------------------------------
=Publish generates the following output:
=
=If the minor version is zero and the XML defines a single Root or Service Object:
=
=- tr-nnn-i-a-c.html          : the standard HTML report
=- tr-nnn-i-a-c-full.xml      : the flattened xml file
=
=If the minor version is greater than zero and the XML defines a single Root or Service Object
=
=- tr-nnn-i-a-c.html          : the standard HTML report
=- tr-nnn-i-a-c-diffs.html    : a HTML report with only the changes from the defined file
=
=If the xml defines a Device and a IGD model and the minor version is zero:
=
=- tr-nnn-i-a-c.html          : the generic html report (automodell option)
=- tr-nnn-i-a-c-dev.html      : the device html report 
=- tr-nnn-i-a-c-igd.html      : the IGD html report 
=- tr-nnn-i-a-c-full.xml      : the flattened xml file
=
=If the minor version is greater than zero and the XML defines multiple Root Objects:
=
=- tr-nnn-i-a-c.html            : the generic html report (automodell option)
=- tr-nnn-i-a-c-diffs.html      : the generic html changes report (automodell option)
=- tr-nnn-i-a-c-dev.html        : the device html report 
=- tr-nnn-i-a-c-dev-diffs.html  : the device html changes report 
=- tr-nnn-i-a-c-igd.html        : the IGD html report 
=- tr-nnn-i-a-c-igd-diffs.html  : the IGD html changes report 
=
=To determine if the xml defines a Device or an IGD data model the XML file is checked if it contains the strings '<model name="Device' and '<model name="InternetGatewayDevice'. 
=
=
=---------------------------------
=  Publish all files in directory
=---------------------------------
=This function simplifies the publishing of a larger amount of data model files. If called it asks for a directory, scans this directory for all xml files. For each file found the publishing output is geenrated as specified for the "Publish" option. 
= Note: the xml files have to be named according BBF naming conventions either as tr-x-x-x.xml or wt-x-x-x.xml to be included into the publishing.
=
=
=---------------------------------
=  Plugins
=---------------------------------
=The report.exe tools supports adding own plugins to generate additional kind of reportts. (see help for report tool)
=Plugins can also be used in the "Expert Report Functions". To add a new plugin to the ReportGUI copy the plugin file <name>.pm 
=into the plugin subdirectory of the ReportGUI. 
=All plugins in the subdirectory are listed under the Expert Report Functions and can be selected from the list.
=Note 1: Only one plugin can be selected at the same time
=Note 2: If a plugin is selected, the report name is set to <input file name>.txt, the report format option is ignored.
=Note 3: The plugin selection is not stored in the profiles
